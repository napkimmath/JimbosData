# JimbosData

New to modding? Follow the instructions [here](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3400691352).

You'll need the following before this mod will work:
1. [Lovely Injector](https://github.com/ethangreen-dev/lovely-injector)
2. [Steamodded](https://github.com/Steamodded/smods/wiki/)

This mod is currently being developed, more features will be added over time.

The purpose of Jimbo's data is to export game data to a CSV on your computer. Currently it has the functionality to export game start data (like seed, deck, etc) and game over data (like cards played, defeated by, etc). Once installed, make sure the manifest.json and all .lua files are directly in ... /Mods/JimbosData/

I went over the humble beginnings during a recent stream - [full walkthrough](https://youtu.be/TM2Eoaf_byo) and [tl;dr version](https://youtu.be/4EKPTbHXVyA).
