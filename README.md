This mod is currently being developed, more features will be added over time.

The purpose of Jimbo's data is to export game data to a CSV on your computer - see releases below to get the full scope. Once installed, make sure the manifest.json and all .lua files are directly in ... /Mods/JimbosData/

I went over the humble beginnings during recent streams:
* [In depth walkthrough and live demo for version 1.0.0](https://www.youtube.com/live/2qSCN6JGgGU?t=216s)
* [Full walkthrough](https://youtu.be/TM2Eoaf_byo) and [tl;dr version](https://youtu.be/4EKPTbHXVyA) for version 0.1.0
